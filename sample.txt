Animation Principles
Core: Squash & Stretch (subtle on breath/exhalation) / Dynamic Timing (slow, deliberate pacing) / Smear Frames (minimal—reserved for snow gusts) / Follow-Through (scarf, hair, falling snow) / Overlapping Action (coat tails, scarf, snow settling)
Style: Clay motion texture with matte, tactile surfaces; slight frame-by-frame grain to emulate handmade stop-motion
Environment: Snow compresses underfoot with visible displacement; pine boughs sway and shed snow in gentle arcs; cold mist clings to ground and breath
00:00 → 00:00 — Setup Frame
Action: Alignment only based on style sheets — neutral pose, balanced composition
Camera: Fixed, centered
Notes: Used as reference input to stabilize character models, lighting, props, and environmental context
00:01 → 00:04 — First Step Beat
Shot: Medium tracking shot from behind, following as Elias lifts a boot from deep snow
Action: Slow, laborious step—snow clings then releases with subtle squash on foot impact; scarf and coat tails lag behind
Camera: Gentle forward dolly with micro-jitter to mimic handheld clay-motion feel
Animation: Overlapping action on scarf and hair; breath mist pulses with each exhale using soft smear
VFX: Snow particles displace upward on step; fine flakes swirl in moonlight with parallax drift
Notes: Emphasize weight and isolation—every movement feels deliberate, heavy, solitary
00:04 → 00:08 — Gust Interlude
Shot: Close-up on Elias’s face as a cold wind gust hits
Action: Hair and scarf whip briefly; eyes narrow but remain fixed ahead; breath mist thickens momentarily
Camera: Slight elastic push-in with subtle frame shake
VFX: Swirling snowflakes accelerate through foreground; pine needles tremble in background
Notes: Rune tattoos subtly shimmer under moonlight for one frame only—barely perceptible
00:08 → 00:12 — Forest Passage
Shot: Side dolly with parallax layers—foreground pines slide past, midground Elias trudges, background fades into silver-blue haze
Action: Steady walking rhythm; coat sways, snow crunches with each step (implied through motion, not sound)
Camera: Smooth lateral movement with clay-textured depth; slight focus shift between layers
Animation: Continuous overlapping motion—scarf flutter, snow settling off shoulders, breath rhythm
VFX: Long shadows stretch from moon; snow glints with micro-sparkles on wind-blown ridges
Notes: Environment breathes with him—snow falls in sync with his pace, as if the forest watches
00:12 → 00:15 — Moon Gaze Pause
Shot: Tight profile close-up as Elias halts and lifts his gaze to the moon
Action: Head tilts slowly; eyes reflect moonlight, exhaustion and resolve intermingled
Camera: Static, shallow depth of field—moon blurred but luminous in background
Animation: Subtle eye blink with slight squash; scarf settles into stillness
VFX: Breath mist curls upward, catching moonlight like faint vapor trails
Notes: Moment of quiet introspection—no wind, no falling snow, only silence and cold light
🎧 Audio
BGM: Muted for clarity
Ambience: Distant wind through high pines, muffled snowfall, faint creak of frozen branches
SFX: Crunch of snow under boots, soft rustle of wool coat, whisper of scarf in breeze
Dialogue: None
